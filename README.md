# Efficient-DVS
Distributed optical fiber vibration sensing algorithm with improved throughput to achieve real-time recognition in real-world long-distance fiber applications.
Improvement is achieved through using shallow CNN and proposed CNN FPGA implementatin scheme. 
The problem of poor generalizability of shallow CNN is solved using knowledge distillation scheme.

This codes allows provides testing codes, example samples and trained models for evaluation
It also provides implemented design in the form of vivado IP for hardware evaluation.
The training codes and hardware design codes will be provided later once the article is published.
