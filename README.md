Welcome to the Efficient-DVS repository! This repository focuses on developing an efficient distributed optical fiber vibration sensing algorithm that achieves real-time recognition in real-world long-distance fiber applications. 

## Key Features

- **Shallow CNN**: We utilize a shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to improve throughput and computational efficiency in the vibration sensing algorithm. This allows for faster real-time recognition of vibration events along the fiber.

- **CNN FPGA Implementation**: To further enhance efficiency, we propose a CNN FPGA implementation scheme. By leveraging the power of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), we enable high parallelism and real-time processing capabilities.

- **Knowledge Distillation**: Addressing the challenge of poor generalizability in shallow CNNs, we employ a knowledge distillation scheme. This technique enhances the generalizability of the lightweight models, resulting in improved accuracy on unknown environment data.

## Repository Contents

This repository provides the necessary codes for the evaluation and simulation of the proposed scheme. It includes:

- **Testing Codes**: You will find codes for testing the efficiency and accuracy of the distributed optical fiber vibration sensing algorithm.

- **Example Samples**: We have included example samples for you to experiment with and evaluate the performance of the algorithm.

- **Trained Models**: Pre-trained models are provided for easy evaluation and testing purposes.

- **Vivado IP**: The repository includes the implemented design in the form of Vivado Intellectual Property (IP) for hardware evaluation on FPGAs.

The complete dataset for training and evaluation is available on Google Drive. Please access the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LK-k0a7M_M6h3VveUCc4wbd_T7ONR1Gb?usp=sharing).
